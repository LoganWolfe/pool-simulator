# Pool Simulation
*This project was independently completed and submitted for credit at Ohio State University.*   
Thus, I am unable to publicly post the code. However, **I will happily review the code privately**.

This program simulates a game of pool using real-world physics such as friction, reflection, velocity, and more.  
The input format for each ball (each on its own line in a text file) is as follows:  
> [Ball #]  [X-Coordinate]  [Y-Coordinate]  [X-Velocity]  [Y-Velocity]  

The program is written completely in C. Graphics and timing libraries were provided by Ohio State University.
