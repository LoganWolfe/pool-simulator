# Pool Simulation
This program simulates a game of pool. Input information about each ball and this program will simulate the rest of the game using real-world physics.
The input format for each ball to include (each on its own line in a text file) is as follows:  
<Ball #>     <X-Coordinate> <Y-Coordinate>     <X-Velocity> <Y-Velocity>  

This program was written completely in C. Graphics libraries were obtained from Ohio State University. This project was independently completed and submitted for credit at Ohio State University. Thus, I am unable to publicly post any code. However, I would happily review the code privately (not for academic purposes).
